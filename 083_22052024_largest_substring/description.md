Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-substring-between-two-equal-characters/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-22

Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return -1.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".
Example 3:

Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
