Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-where-max-element-appears-at-least-k-times/description/

You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k.
Return the number of subarrays where the maximum element of nums appears at least k times in that subarray.
A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.



Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,3], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarrays that contain the element 3 at least 2 times are: [1,3,2,3], [1,3,2,3,3], [3,2,3], [3,2,3,3], [2,3,3] and [3,3].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,4,2,1], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: No subarray contains the element 4 at least 3 times.
 
Example 3:
nums = [61,23,38,23,56,40,82,56,82,82,82,70,8,69,8,7,19,14,58,42,82,10,82,78,15,82], k = 2
output: 224

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 106
1 <= k <= 105
